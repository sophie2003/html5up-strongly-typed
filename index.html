											<h3>Growing up and childhood</h3>
											<p>Ariana Grande may be a star, but she says that there was a time when she was a strange little girl. Grande said that she had very weird tastes and ideas as a child and said that her mother was even concerned for her at one point.

												"For my fifth birthday we had ajaws theme and all my friends left crying. I mean, I still am that way. But when i was little it was more concerning," Grande said. "There was a stage, when i was 3 or 4, where my mom though i might grown up to be a serial killer."

												"I always wanted to have a skeleton face paint on or be wearing a Freddy Krueger mask, and I would carry a hockey stick around. I was like a mini-helena Bonham Carter," she added.

												To make matters worse, Grande was hypoglycemic and said that she would turn into a "Tasmainian devil" at times and drive her mother crazy.

												Grande also said that she was a bit of a rebel as a child and that although she was brought up Catholic, she decided to find her own religion when she was just 12 years old. She now practices Kabbalah and said that she understands how hard it is to be true to your religion while also being a celebrity.

												Grande has matured a lot over the last few years and is now a busy 21-year-old.

											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Breathin music video image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Ariana Grande is said to have been determined to progress with a musical career from age 13, aspiring to create an R&B album at only age 14. However, Ariana only became truly famous after she was casted as 'Cat Valentine' in the hit Nikelodeon television show 'Victorious'.

												Ariana’s interest in music was demonstrated at an early age. She performed on cruise ships, with the Ft. Lauderdale Music theater and she even sang the Star Spangled Banner at a Carolina Panthers game.

Ariana Grande net worth is reported to be about $50M. Now, let’s look at some of the ways that Ariana has amassed her wealth. It begins with Ariana acting career which actually took off before her singing career. She landed a spot on Victorious in 2009, which one of Nickelodeon’s hottest shows ever. In fact, the show premiered with an audience of 5.7 million viewers, which is the second largest audience in the history of the network. The second season of the show hit an even higher mark of 6.2 viewers.

During her time on "Victorious," Grande began writing music. Her first album, "Yours Truly," was released in 2013. The first single on the album "The Way" featuring Mac Miller, became a top 10 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number nine. The album sold 138,000 copies sold in its first week.

One of the first accolades the singer received was the American Music Award for Best New Artist which she won in 2013.

Since then, she's released three more albums. In 2014, she released "My Everything" and the debut single 'Problem' topped the charts across the world. It sold 169,000 copies in its first week and Ariana was top of the Billboard charts.
